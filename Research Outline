Units: RPKM, FPKM, & TPM
> RPKM (Reads per Kilobase Million)
> FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase Million)
> TPM (Transcripts per Kilobase Million(

  > RPKM Calculation

    Scaling Factor = (Total reads in sample/1,000,000)            //Normalize for sequencing depth
    RPM = (Read count/Scaling Factor)                             //Normalize for gene length
    RPKM = (RPM/gene length [Kilobases])
  
  > TPM Calculation 

    RPK = (Read count/gene length [Kilobases]                     //Normalize for gene length first
    Scaling Factor = (Sum RPK values/1,000,000)                   //Normalize for sequencing depth
    TPM = (RPK/Scaling Factor)
 
  > TPM vs. RPKM: TPM values in different samples will always be the same (same denominator across samples)
